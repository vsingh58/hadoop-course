Hadoop has established itself as an industry-leading platform for deploying cloud-based applications and services. Hadoop eco-system is sizable in nature and includes many products such as HDFS, Map/Reduce, HBase, Zookeeper, Oozie, Pig, and Hive. With such versatility comes complexity and good use-case utilization uncertainty. This course breaks down the walls of complexity by providing a practical approach to developing Java applications on top of Hadoop platform.

The course presents the material as small building blocks with a thorough coverage of each component in the Hadoop stack. We begin by looking at Hadoopâ€™s architecture and its underlying parts with topdown identification of component interactions within the Hadoop eco-system. The course then provides in-depth coverage of Hadoop Distributed FileSystem (HDFS), HBase, Map/Reduce, Oozie, Pig and Hive. To re-enforce concepts, each section is followed by a set of hands-on exercises. The exercises come in various complexities to accommodate developers with various levels of expertise
